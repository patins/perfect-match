## Dynamic Greedy Algorithm
Finds a matching using the greedy algorithm and presents an efficient solution to compute a matching with the addition of a single edge (should return the greedy solution, which is a 1/2 approximation).
A sketch of the algorithm can be found here: https://www.overleaf.com/read/wdwsrjmxdpbw
